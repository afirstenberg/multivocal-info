  <b>Multivocal 0.18.0 now available</b>
</p>
<p>
  This release has been focused on support for multiple voices, now officially
  in the SSML for Google Assistant. In particular:

  <ul>
    <li>
      Updating <a href="https://speechmarkdown.org/">SpeechMarkdown</a> to
      depend on version 2.0.0.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is also enhanced SpeechMarkdown support, such that the Voices
      environment object is passed to SpeechMarkdown as part of the configuration,
      so the voices available through the [voice] markdown are set from multivocal.
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
  </ul>

  Documentation has been added to the readme, and there is also new
  <a href="https://github.com/afirstenberg/multivocal-example-voice">example code</a>
  to illustrate.
</p>

<p>
  There are also minor changes, some meant to set the stage for future improvements,
  including:
  <ul>
    <li>
      More straighforward ways to calculate the platform versions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Support for determining the Action name from the Intent, for platforms
      that don't support the concept of Action.
    </li>
    <li>
      Performance improvements, particularly in key validation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Improvements in logging and timing analysis.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
