  <b>Multivocal 0.15.2 now available</b>
</p>
<p>
  This release adds more support for the Actions Builder / Actions SDK
  for the Google Assistant (Actions on Google v3) and introduces <i>very</i>
  preliminary support for Dialogflow CX (Dialogflow v3).
  Additional features supported are:
<ul>
  <li>
    Media controls for AoG v3 have been restructured slightly, providing
    access to the media progress, setting start time for a media response
    audio, and setting if pause and stop should trigger Intents.
  </li>
  <li>
    "Scenes" in Actions Builder and "Pages" in Dialogflow CS are generally
    tracked in multivocal as "Nodes".
  </li>
  <li>
    Nodes are now tracked as part of the session counter and session consecutive
    environment values.
  </li>
  <li>
    A new session environment value known as the "stack" will keep track of
    the five most recent Node names.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can set the "NextNode" environment setting to indicate the next Node
    to transition to after this reply. There are also special values
    to indicate to transition back to the current node, the previous node,
    and so forth.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
