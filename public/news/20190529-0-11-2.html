  <b>Multivocal 0.11.2 now available</b>
</p>
<p>
  0.11.2 is a bugfix release, addressing some issues found when running on Node 8.
</p>
<p>
  Version 0.11.1 introduced support for AoG's "Immersive Canvas" feature, which
  allows an HTML page to be rendered on Assistants with screens (such as
  Android and the Home Hub).
</p>
<p>
  An <a href="https://github.com/afirstenberg/multivocal-example-canvas">example</a>
  is now available illustrating some basic functionality for the immersive canvas.
</p>
<p>
  Additional changes/fixes since 0.10.0:
<ul>
  <li>Fixes for requirements, particularly the sign-in requirement.</li>
  <li>Additional information when a requirement is not met.</li>
  <li>Fix pre-processing path for Google's healthcheck ping.</li>
  <li>Suggestions can now come from either Msg or Suffix.</li>
  <li>Documentation clarifying how Response Templates work.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  (There are no changes from 0.11.0. The version bump is due to npm having
  a mangled copy of 0.11.0 and no way to fix it.)
