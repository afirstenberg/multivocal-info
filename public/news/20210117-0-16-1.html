  <b>Multivocal 0.16.1 now available</b>
</p>
<p>
  Version 0.16.1 fixes a bug in the UUID handling. The main new features
  are those from 0.16.0, listed below.
</p>
<p>

There have been a number of wide-ranging changes, with the broad goals of
making templating easier, debugging easier, and generally "doing the right
thing" either easier or the default. Some specifics:

<ul>

  <li>
    SpeechMarkdown is now used as a core part of the templating system in
    two ways:
    <ul>
      <li>
        If providing just a string for the response, it is processed (by
        default) through SpeechMarkdown to create the Text and Ssml values.
      </li>
      <li>
        It can also be set as the Markdown attribute for the object and it
        will set the Text and Ssml values if you don't also set them. This lets
        you use Markdown to generate the Ssml (for example), but still provide
        alternate text.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    The strangely named "flexiresponse" allows you to build values in the
    configuration using similar templates to those you use for `Response`.
    You can then reference or include them in the `Response` itself, making
    it easier to build templates tailored for specific modes or platforms,
    but which all use other templated or selected responses.
  </li>

  <li>
    Templating can now add to a Debug object. This is available through
    the "multivocal_debug" session variable. It is particularly useful
    to be used as part of the new test framework available from Google,
    so you can assert particular values set in the environment, rather than
    needing to test a wide range of possible response strings.
  </li>

  <li>
    Hostname is now set in the environment. This is useful for setting
    the path for an HTML Page that needs to be referenced at the same
    host URL as your webhook (a common thing to do with Firebase Hosting,
    for example).
  </li>

  <li>
    Requests coming from Actions Builder / SDK (AoG 3) are now validated
    by default. The project name is loaded from Google Cloud / Fireabse
    environment variables by default, and you can override this setting
    if necessary. (You can also turn off this validation... but don't do that
    unless you have a really good reason.) Thanks to Denis Valášek for his
    insights that made this feature far easier to use.
  </li>

  <li>
    There's a new configuration loader which loads from simpler key-value
    pairs, rather than a more complete nested object hierarchy.
  </li>

</ul>

Additionally, there have been several dependency updates, including moving
from the <tt>request-promise-native</tt> package, which has been deprecated,
to the <tt>axios</tt> package.
