  <b>Multivocal 0.15.0 now available</b>
</p>
<p>
  This release brings support for two new platforms:
  <ul>
    <li>Actions Builder / Actions SDK for the Google Assistant (Actions on Google v3)</li>
    <li>Google Chat (formerly Hangouts Chat) under Dialogflow</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  The Actions Builder/SDK support directly handles platform features such as
  <ul>
    <li>First Simple / Last Simple prompts</li>
    <li>Using the "handler name" as the Action name</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Both implementations are a bit raw still, and we welcome feedback (and patches!).
  But it is also pleasing to note that adding both platforms was fairly straightforward,
  and we look forward to using these lessons to expand to more platforms.
