  <b>Multivocal 0.12.0 now available</b>
</p>
<p>
  The main update in this release is support for <i>postprocessing</i> - code
  that will run after the reply is sent. This is particularly useful for
  operations, such as database saves or logging, that don't need to take time
  before the reply.
</p>
<p>
  Also notable, tho largely internal:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Record timing for various stages of processing. (And report these as part
      of postprocessing by default.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Performance improvements for configuration handling.
    </li>
  </ul>
