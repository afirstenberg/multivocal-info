  <b>Multivocal 0.17.1 now available</b>
</p>
<p>

  The focus of this release is improved support for Dialogflow CX
  (Dialogflow 3). Consult the
  <a href="https://github.com/afirstenberg/multivocal/blob/master/docs/notes-dialogflow3.md"
    target="_top">
    platform notes
  </a>
  for some details, but to summarize:

<ul>

  <li>
    Added support for the Dialogflow Messenger and generic telephony integrations.
  </li>

  <li>
    Improved locale handling to make it consistent with other platforms.
  </li>

  <li>
    Webhook request verification using the provided Authorization header.
  </li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>
  As part of this, there have been a number of changes behind the scenes
  which should improve other platforms as well.
</p>

<p>
  (Version 0.17.0 is identical, but there were some omissions in documentation
  which were fixed for 0.17.1.)
