  <b>Multivocal 0.15.1 now available</b>
</p>
<p>
  This release updates support for the Actions Builder / Actions SDK
  for the Google Assistant (Actions on Google v3). Additional features
  supported are:
<ul>
  <li>
    List / Collection (formerly called Carousel) support using the same
    format as used for Dialogflow.
  </li>
  <li>
    This hides many of the implementation details, although it does require
    you to use specific names for the slot and type. You can override these
    in the settings.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
