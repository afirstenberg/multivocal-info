  <b>Multivocal 0.10.0 now available</b>
</p>
<p>
  This release introduces <i>levels</i>, which allow you to easily set which
  responses will be available in an escalating way. For example, you can set
  some welcome responses for first time visitors, some for new repeat visitors,
  and some for experienced users. Levels are flexible and highly configurable.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="https://github.com/afirstenberg/multivocal-example-simple">simple example</a>
  has also been updated to illustrate how to use levels with no additional configuration.
